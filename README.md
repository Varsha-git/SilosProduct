# SilosProduct

Silos is the name of my project which I done while persuing Post Graduate Program of Full Stack Product Engineering from Stackroute( an NIIT venture).

Abstract requirement: :

Enterprises have large teams working in silos. 
Individuals and teams in organisations have a lot of skills and experiences across projects that remain hidden.
Often management and employees come with innovative ideas that can be fulfilled within the organisation itself. 
But such ideas fail execution because of a lack of the ideal team.
How can someone who has an idea get the team with the right capability to execute it?
How can employees contribute their skills and experience to ideas of their interests?
How can the problem of matching an idea with the right set of people be solved?

As team of 8 people in this project , we created a platform where people with innovative idea can get an ideal team.Those people can sign up themselves as Ideapreneur on regsiter page. 

People who are interested into contributing their skills and experience as a team member can sign up as service supplier on register page.

According to your role , dashboard view will be displayed.Then,here you can get ideal team or become a member of a team.
I was introduced to a new technlogy named as Neo4j. 
Neo4j was used for recommendaion of ideas or service supplier.
